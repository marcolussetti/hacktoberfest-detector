# hacktoberfest-detector

A very, very simple and very, very dumb Firefox Add-On to check whether a repository in GitHub is opted-in to the hacktoberfest tag.

## Installation

Addon is pending approval from Mozilla at the moment.

You can install it for now from https://github.com/marcolussetti/hacktoberfest-detector/releases/download/1.2.1/hacktoberfest_detector-1.2.1-an+fx.xpi

## Usage

A green alert will appear on all main project pages where the repository has opted in to hacktoberfest.
