# hacktoberfest-detector

A very, very simple and very, very dumb Firefox & Chrome Add-On to check whether a repository in GitHub is opted-in to the hacktoberfest tag.

## Installation

### Firefox

Install from the Firefox Add-On Store: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hacktoberfest-detector/

Alternatively, you can install it any beta releases, if required by running the XPI file from the [Releases section](https://github.com/marcolussetti/hacktoberfest-detector/releases).

### Chrome / Chromium

Install from the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacktoberfest-detector/nnhdnknkgcgamopigjbadnmocnemhbin

Alternatively, you can install any beta releases by:

- Download this repository somewhere, as a folder
- Browse to chrome://extensions/
- Enable the developer mode in the top right by switching the toggle, if necessary
- Click "Load Unpacked" from the top left side
- Browse to the folder and click OK

## Usage

A green alert will appear on all main project pages where the repository has opted in to hacktoberfest.
